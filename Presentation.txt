Problem:
	Google's Tensorflow API has gpu support for only Nvidea GPUs, this leaves anybody
	with other gpus rendered to a huge disadvantage in implementations of NN. It
	gives Nvidia a monopoly on common nueral network accelleration.

Our proposal:
	We propose the creation of an api that can be used with any openCL
	enabled device. This API should be simple to use but have a high level of
	customization.

Research:
	As it is now, Google offers no official support of openCL for TensorFlow.
	Upon further research it becomes apparant that none of the big NN APIs support
	openCL.
