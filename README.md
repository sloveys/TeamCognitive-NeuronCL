# TeamCognitive-NeuronCL

Goal is to build a Neural Network Framework in Python using OpenCL acceleration.

ToDos:
Design API (data abstraction/input && Neural Network assembly && Training Model Calls && Data output)
Design Neuron Structure (Theory: Choked Neuron Structure {possibly complete?} || Tensor Product Neuron Structure)
Implement Neuron Structure
Design Neural Network Structure
Implement Neural Network Structure
Design Training model (Back Propagation)
