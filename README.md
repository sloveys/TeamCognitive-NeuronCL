# TeamCognitive-NeuronCL

Goal is to build a Neural Network Framework in Python using OpenCL acceleration.

### Warning: this project is a work in progress.

### ToDos:
Make improvements and optimizations to training model and run function:
 * Cython implementation
 * Reduction of redundant operations
 * OpenCL optimizations & greater use of OpenCL
 * Current network modifications are likely random, a non-random or less-random redesign should be implemented

Review neuron structure:
 * Neuron normalization should be reviewed
 * Neuron core operations should be reviewed
 * Other neuron structures should be reviewed

Package project for use as a library
