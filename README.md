# TeamCognitive-NeuronCL

Goal is to build a Neural Network Framework in Python using OpenCL acceleration.

Warning: this project is a work in progress.

ToDos:
Make improvements and optimizations to training model and run function:
  Cython implementation
  Reduction of redundant operations
  OpenCL optimizations & greater use of OpenCL
  Current network modifications are likely random, a non-random or less-random redesign should be implemented

Review neuron structure:
  Neuron normalization should be reviewed
  Neuron core operations should be reviewed
  Other neuron structures should be reviewed

Package project for use as a library
