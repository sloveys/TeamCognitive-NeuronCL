# TeamCognitive-NeuronCL

Goal is to build a Neural Network Framework in Python using OpenCL acceleration.

Warning: this project is a work in progress.

ToDos:
Make improvements and optimizations to training model and run function:
   -Cython implementation
   -Reduction of redundant operations
   -OpenCL optimizations & greater use of OpenCL
   -Current network modifications are likely random, a non-random or less-random redesign should be implemented

Review neuron structure:
   -neuron normalization should be reviewed
   -neuron core operations should be reviewed
   -other neuron structures should be reviewed

Package project for use as a library
